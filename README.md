# Project Setup and Usage Guide

## Required Libraries and Tools

- **C and C++ Compiler** (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- **CMake** (for configuring the project)
- **Make** or **Ninja** (for building the project)

## make build

Builds the project and compiles the executable.

## make clean

Removes the build directory. This command is rarely needed, but can be useful when the build gets corrupted or you want to clean up.
